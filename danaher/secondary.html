		<div class="panel" >
			<p>Good news—several medical insurance carriers will be available for you to choose from. More choice means you have the power to find a plan that’s truly best for you. </p>
  
				<p>Find out why else more medical insurance carriers is a good thing.[Link to Choose Your Medical Insurance Carrier]</p>
				<p>Overwhelmed by options? Don’t worry! The Help Me Choose tool when you enroll will make it super easy to see the best fit for you. [Link to MyDanaherBenefits.com]</p>
				<p>FYI, most people will continue to have two medical plan options—with new names: 
					<ul><li>•	The Health Plus Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Silver Plan in 2019. </li>
					<li>The Basic Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Gold Plan in 2019.</li></ul></p>
					<br>If you want more detail, you can see a side-by-side comparison. [Link to Medical and Rx page] 
					<p>Note: There are differences if you live in California, [Link to California page] Hawaii, [Link to Hawaii page], and for U.S. Expatriates. [Link to U.S. Expatriates page]</p>

        <h4 class="accordion">Updates to the Health Savings Account (HSA) </h4>
			 <div class="panel" >
          <p>The HSA is a great way to save money on health care expenses! And now, if you enroll in the lowest-cost Silver plan, you’ll be “ahead” on your health care spend, which gives you a nice starting point for contributing to an HSA. </p>

			<p>Also, this is important: If you have an existing HSA with Optum, the bank is changing to Fidelity. You need to take action to move your account during enrollment if you want to avoid hassle and fees later. </p>

				<h4 class="panel accord">How Help Me Choose works </h4>
				<div id="accord_section">
					<ul><li>Combines data from several sources to score each medical plan—your personal information, such as age, gender, ZIP code, prescription medication history, preferred doctors, and how you like to pay for things.* Also factors in national trends in health care costs and claims. </li>
					<li>Then it “predicts” how much each medical plan will cost you and how useful the benefits may be for you, and scores each option accordingly. The scores range from 1 to 100. The higher the score, the better the fit for you</li>
					<li>Get the estimated Annual RealCost™ of each plan, too—how much it would cost you to buy (what you pay out of your paycheck), and how much it predicts you’ll pay out of pocket to use the plan throughout the year. It’s based on your specific health needs and claims data from thousands of plan participants.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
							* The personal information used to calculate your results is kept completely confidential and will not be seen by Danaher.

				  </div>
				<h4 class="panel accord">If you don’t enroll  </h4>
					 <div id="accord_section">
						 <ul><li>For 2019, you’ll have the medical plan and carrier that’s closest to what you have today in coverage and price. (If you declined medical coverage last year and don’t enroll November 1 – 20, you’ll continue to waive medical coverage for 2019.)</li>
						<li>You won’t be saving money in a tax-free Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA). </li>
					<li>The rest of your benefits will remain the same.</li>
					<li>If you currently have an HSA with Optum, you’ll miss the easy, free way to move your HSA balance to the new bank, Fidelity. </li>
					<li>You won’t be able to make any changes until the next Annual Enrollment period (unless you have a qualifying event, like getting married or having a baby.)</li>
