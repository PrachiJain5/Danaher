		<div class="panel" >
			<p>Good news—several medical insurance carriers will be available for you to choose from. More choice means you have the power to find a plan that’s truly best for you. </p>
  
				<p>Find out why else more medical insurance carriers is a good thing.[Link to Choose Your Medical Insurance Carrier]</p>
				<p>Overwhelmed by options? Don’t worry! The Help Me Choose tool when you enroll will make it super easy to see the best fit for you. [Link to MyDanaherBenefits.com]</p>
				<p>FYI, most people will continue to have two medical plan options—with new names: 
					<ul><li>•	The Health Plus Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Silver Plan in 2019. </li>
					<li>The Basic Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Gold Plan in 2019.</li></ul></p>
					<br>If you want more detail, you can see a side-by-side comparison. [Link to Medical and Rx page] 
					<p>Note: There are differences if you live in California, [Link to California page] Hawaii, [Link to Hawaii page], and for U.S. Expatriates. [Link to U.S. Expatriates page]</p>

          <p>The HSA is a great way to save money on health care expenses! And now, if you enroll in the lowest-cost Silver plan, you’ll be “ahead” on your health care spend, which gives you a nice starting point for contributing to an HSA. </p>

			<p>Also, this is important: If you have an existing HSA with Optum, the bank is changing to Fidelity. You need to take action to move your account during enrollment if you want to avoid hassle and fees later. </p>

				<h4 class="panel accord">Danaher’s contribution </h4>
				<div id="accord_section">
					<ul><li>How Danaher contributes to the cost of your medical coverage will work differently in 2019. </li>
					<li>You’ll receive the same “subsidy” amount from the company, but how it’s applied will change. It will go toward reducing the amount you pay per paycheck for your medical coverage.</li>
					<li>With this change, Danaher will not contribute to your HSA in 2019.</li>
                    <li>If you enroll in a low-cost Silver plan, you could end up paying less out of your paycheck than you do today.</li>    
                </ul>
					<p><b>Take the opportunity to “get ahead” on expenses</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since you’re already used to a certain amount of money coming out of your paycheck, consider “reinvesting” your money into your HSA. You’ll see minimal (if any) impact to your paycheck if you contribute:
                            <ul><li>$500 for associate only coverage</li> 
                            <li>$1,000 for associate + family* coverage (*2 or more people)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>But don’t stop there! Take it to the next level by contributing enough to cover your medical plan deductible. Or anywhere in between. </li>
                        <li>If you choose, you can contribute all the way up to the IRS maximum (if you’re under age 55—$3,500 for associate only coverage/$7,000 for associate + family coverage, or if over 55, $4,500 and $8,000). </li>
                        <li>Use the online tools when you enroll to decide the right amount to contribute. </li>
                        
                    </ul>

						 <ul><li>The bank that manages our HSA is changing from Optum to Fidelity. </li>

					<li>It’s your choice to move the money or not—just know that it’s more complicated after November 20 and you’ll have to pay a $20 transfer fee if you decide to move it later</li>
