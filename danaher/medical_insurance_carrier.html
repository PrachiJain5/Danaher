			<p>Good news—several medical insurance carriers will be available for you to choose from. More choice means you have the power to find a plan that’s truly best for you. </p>
  
				<p>Find out why else more medical insurance carriers is a good thing.[Link to Choose Your Medical Insurance Carrier]</p>
				<p>Overwhelmed by options? Don’t worry! The Help Me Choose tool when you enroll will make it super easy to see the best fit for you. [Link to MyDanaherBenefits.com]</p>
				<p>FYI, most people will continue to have two medical plan options—with new names: 
					<ul><li>•	The Health Plus Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Silver Plan in 2019. </li>
					<li>The Basic Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Gold Plan in 2019.</li></ul></p>
					<br>If you want more detail, you can see a side-by-side comparison. [Link to Medical and Rx page] 
					<p>Note: There are differences if you live in California, [Link to California page] Hawaii, [Link to Hawaii page], and for U.S. Expatriates. [Link to U.S. Expatriates page]</p>

          <p>The HSA is a great way to save money on health care expenses! And now, if you enroll in the lowest-cost Silver plan, you’ll be “ahead” on your health care spend, which gives you a nice starting point for contributing to an HSA. </p>

			<p>Also, this is important: If you have an existing HSA with Optum, the bank is changing to Fidelity. You need to take action to move your account during enrollment if you want to avoid hassle and fees later. </p>

							<br>Your plans will also be different. Learn more 
							
					</p>
				  </div> 
				  <h4 class="panel accord">Prescription drugs </h4>
					 <div id="accord_section">
						<p>Your prescription drug coverage in 2019 depends on the medical plan you choose and your medical insurance carrier:
							<ul><li>CVS Caremark will continue to manage your prescription drug benefits if you enroll in a medical plan through Aetna, CareFirst, Cigna, or UnitedHealthcare</li>
							<li>A different company will manage your prescription drug benefits if you enroll in a medical plan through Kaiser Permanente, Health Net, Dean / Prevea360, Geisinger, Medical Mutual or UPMC.</li>
							<li>se the prescription drug search tool when you enroll to see how your medication is covered under each plan. </li>
						</ul>
						</p>
				</div>
				<h4 class="panel accord">Quick tips for choosing </h4>
					 <div id="accord_section">
						<p>Here are a few smart questions to consider when comparing the medical insurance carriers:
							<ol>
								<li><strong> Who’s</strong> in network? Which carriers include my doctors? </li>
								<p><br>Note they all have quality doctors, hospitals, urgent care clinics, and more that offer you discounts. When you enroll, use the tools to see which carriers include your doctors and the hospitals or other facilities you like to go to.
						
							<li><strong> What</strong> does my prescription drug coverage look like? <strong> How much </strong> will my medications cost? Is my local pharmacy in the network?  
								<p><br>If you or a covered family member regularly takes medication, find out what to pay attention to. When you enroll, you’ll be able to see how your specific medications will be covered.</p>
							</li>
							<li><strong> What</strong> other services does the carrier offer? What would help me get healthy and/or stay healthy?</li>
							<p><br>Compare the “extras” a carrier might offer, including:
								<ul>
									<li>Telemedicine</li>
									<li>Health experts</li>
									<li>Discount programs</li>
									<li>Extended customer service hours</li>
									<li>Mobile apps and tools</li>
									<li>Mental health resources (in addition to services available through Danaher’s Employee Assistance Program)</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
							<li><strong>How much</strong> will it cost me? 
							<p>Each carrier sets its own price per paycheck for the plan you select. The Pricing Modeler [open tool] shows who’s offering you the best deal, and how much it will cost. You’ll need an access code to use it—find the code that was sent to you via email, or in the printed guide mailed home.*</p>
							<h6>*Note the Pricing Modeler is not available to associates in Hawaii or U.S. Expatriates.</h6>
							</li>	
						</p>

						</ol>
						<p>

						</p><strong>Is your address up to date?</strong>
						Your specific options are based on where you live—so it’s important to make sure your address in Workday is correct before you enroll.
