	<div><strong>New medical insurance carrier choices  </strong>
        <p>You’ll have two new carrier options to choose from—Kaiser Permanente or HMSA. Your current medical insurance carrier—UnitedHealthcare—will no longer be an option for you.  </p>
        
        <strong>New medical plan options </strong>
        <p>You’ll have two new medical plan options to choose from—Gold or Platinum—and you can choose whether you prefer a PPO-type plan (like you currently have) or an HMO</p>
        <p>Note that in an HMO, the plan doesn’t cover any care you get from doctors, hospitals, and other providers outside the carrier’s network.  </p>
		<p>This chart shows what you pay for covered services using in-network providers. </p>

		<p>*You must have a doctor's prescription for the medication—even for products sold over the counter (OTC)—and you must use an in-network retail pharmacy or mail-order service.</p>
		<p>These charts may not take into account how each coverage level covers any state-mandated benefits, its plan administration capabilities, or the approval from the state Department of Insurance of the benefits offered by the plan. If you have questions about a specific benefit, contact the insurance carrier for additional information. </p>
		<p>These charts are a high-level listing of commonly for covered benefits across carriers and coverage levels. They are intended to provide you with a snapshot of benefits provided across coverage levels. In general, carriers have agreed to the majority of standardized plan benefits recommended by the exchange. Individual carriers may offer coverage that differs slightly from the standard coverage reflected here. </p>
		<p>MyDanaherBenefits.com gives a more detailed look at these and additional coverages—and does account for some carrier adjustments to standardized plan benefits. To see summaries when you enroll online, check the boxes next to the options you want to review and click Compare. In order to get the most comprehensive information about any specific coverage, you will need to call the carrier directly</p>

			<p>Good news—several medical insurance carriers will be available for you to choose from. More choice means you have the power to find a plan that’s truly best for you. </p>
  
				<p>Find out why else more medical insurance carriers is a good thing.[Link to Choose Your Medical Insurance Carrier]</p>
				<p>Overwhelmed by options? Don’t worry! The Help Me Choose tool when you enroll will make it super easy to see the best fit for you. [Link to MyDanaherBenefits.com]</p>
				<p>FYI, most people will continue to have two medical plan options—with new names: 
					<ul><li>•	The Health Plus Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Silver Plan in 2019. </li>
					<li>The Basic Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Gold Plan in 2019.</li></ul></p>
					<br>If you want more detail, you can see a side-by-side comparison. [Link to Medical and Rx page]

          <p>The HSA is a great way to save money on health care expenses! And now, if you enroll in the lowest-cost Silver plan, you’ll be “ahead” on your health care spend, which gives you a nice starting point for contributing to an HSA. </p>

			<p>Also, this is important: If you have an existing HSA with Optum, the bank is changing to Fidelity. You need to take action to move your account during enrollment if you want to avoid hassle and fees later. </p>
