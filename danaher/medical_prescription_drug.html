		<p>Includes out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs. Amounts paid toward your deductible under both Silver and Gold plans are included in the annual out-of-pocket maximum. It doesn’t include amounts taken out of your paycheck for health coverage.</p>
		<p>This chart may not take into account how each coverage level covers any state-mandated benefits, its plan administration capabilities, or the approval from the state Department of Insurance of the benefits offered by the plan. If you have questions about a specific benefit, contact the carrier for additional information.</p>
		<p>	Out-of-network charges will not count toward your in-network annual deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. The same goes for in-network charges—they will not count toward your out-of-network annual deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. 
                Some insurance carriers in CA, CO, DC, GA, MD, OR, VA, and WA do not cover out-of-network benefits at all. </p>
		<p>MyDanaherBenefits.com gives a more detailed look at these and additional coverages—and does account for some carrier adjustments to standardized plan benefits. To see summaries when you enroll online, check the boxes next to the options you want to review and click Compare. In order to get the most comprehensive information about any specific coverage, you will need to call the carrier directly.</p>

			<p>Good news—several medical insurance carriers will be available for you to choose from. More choice means you have the power to find a plan that’s truly best for you. </p>

				<p>FYI, most people will continue to have two medical plan options—with new names: 
					<ul><li>•	The Health Plus Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Silver Plan in 2019. </li>
					<li>The Basic Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Gold Plan in 2019.</li></ul></p>
