		<p>*Includes out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs. Amounts paid toward your deductible under both Silver and Gold plans are included in the annual out-of-pocket maximum. It doesn’t include amounts taken out of your paycheck for health coverage.</p>
		<p>This chart may not take into account how each coverage level covers any state-mandated benefits, its plan administration capabilities, or the approval from the state Department of Insurance of the benefits offered by the plan. If you have questions about a specific benefit, contact the carrier for additional information.</p>
		<p>	Out-of-network charges will not count toward your in-network annual deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. The same goes for in-network charges—they will not count toward your out-of-network annual deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. 
                Some insurance carriers in CA, CO, DC, GA, MD, OR, VA, and WA do not cover out-of-network benefits at all. </p>
		<p><a href="http:MyDanaherBenefits.com">MyDanaherBenefits.com</a> gives a more detailed look at these and additional coverages—and does account for some carrier adjustments to standardized plan benefits. To see summaries when you enroll online, check the boxes next to the options you want to review and click Compare. In order to get the most comprehensive information about any specific coverage, you will need to call the carrier directly.</p>

                    <p>	How the out-of-pocket maximum works depends on the plan you choose: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>It’s a “true family” out-of-pocket maximum in the Silver plan: </b>This means the entire family out-of-pocket maximum must be met before your insurance will pay the full cost of covered charges for any covered family member. There is no “individual out-of-pocket maximum” when you have family coverage.</li>
                        <li><b>It’s a “traditional” out-of-pocket maximum in the Gold plan: </b>Once a covered family member meets the <b>individual</b> out-of-pocket maximum, your insurance will pay the full cost of covered charges for that family member. Charges for all covered family members will continue to count toward the family out-of-pocket maximum. Once the family out-of-pocket maximum is met, your insurance will pay the full cost of covered charges for all covered family members. </li>
