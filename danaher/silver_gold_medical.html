			<p>Good news—several medical insurance carriers will be available for you to choose from. More choice means you have the power to find a plan that’s truly best for you. </p>
  
				<p>Find out why else more medical insurance carriers is a good thing.[Link to Choose Your Medical Insurance Carrier]</p>
				<p>Overwhelmed by options? Don’t worry! The Help Me Choose tool when you enroll will make it super easy to see the best fit for you. [Link to MyDanaherBenefits.com]</p>
				<p>FYI, most people will continue to have two medical plan options—with new names: 
					<ul><li>•	The Health Plus Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Silver Plan in 2019. </li>
					<li>The Basic Plan in 2018 is now closest to the Gold Plan in 2019.</li></ul></p>

          <p>The HSA is a great way to save money on health care expenses! And now, if you enroll in the lowest-cost Silver plan, you’ll be “ahead” on your health care spend, which gives you a nice starting point for contributing to an HSA. </p>

			<p>Also, this is important: If you have an existing HSA with Optum, the bank is changing to Fidelity. You need to take action to move your account during enrollment if you want to avoid hassle and fees later. </p>

                                <li><strong>“Traditional” out-of-pocket maximum in the Gold plan: </strong>Once a covered family member meets the <b>individual</b> out-of-pocket maximum, your insurance will pay the full cost of covered charges for that family member.
