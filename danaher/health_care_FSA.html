        <h3>Choosing the Gold plan in 2019, or perhaps you’re covered by your spouse’s plan? Consider a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) to help you save money on health care expenses throughout the year.</h3>
        <p>With a Health Care FSA* you can set aside dollars from your paycheck before taxes are taken out to reimburse yourself for eligible out-of-pocket expenses. </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Estimate your expenses for the calendar year, such as deductibles and copays, eyeglasses, braces, and hearing aids,.</li>
            <li>Decide how much money you want to contribute for the year.</li> 
            <li>Then use the money in your Health Care FSA beginning January 1 to pay for qualified health care expenses tax-free,</li>
            <li>Like medical care, chiropractic care, prescription drug expenses, dental or vision care, or even alternative therapies.</li>
            <li>Use it to pay for expenses during the year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Find a list of eligible expenses here: </p>
        <small>*Note that because associates who are on long-term disability do not receive a paycheck, they aren’t eligible to enroll in the Health Care FSA because paycheck contributions are required to use the account. </small>
