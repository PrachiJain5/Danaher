	<div  style=" padding-top: 30px;">Make your move <b>November 1 – 20, 2018</b>
		<ul><li>Go to MyDanaherBenefits.com beginning November 1. Sign in automatically from Danaher Connect. Or enter the same user ID and password on the new site as you use today on <b>MyBenefits.MyDanaher.com.</b></li>
<li>Have doctors’ names and information about regular medications handy so you can see which medical plan options work best.</li>
<li><b>Don’t miss out on choosing the medical insurance carrier you want.</b> </li>
<li>Decide how much to contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA) in 2019. If you currently have an HSA with Optum, check the box to move your money to Fidelity. </li>
<li>Enroll for other benefits: dental, vision, life insurance, etc. If you don’t make any changes, your 2018 benefits will continue in 2019</li>
<li>Update your life and AD&D insurance beneficiaries if you need to  </li></ul>

<p><strong>Take 15 minutes to find your perfect match </strong></p>


<p>There’s a lot to consider when you choose a medical plan, and more choices can feel a little overwhelming. But don’t worry! There’s a fast and easy way to find the best plan for you. Just use the Help Me Choose tool when you enroll.</p>

	<p>All you need to do is take 15 minutes to enter some basic information about yourself and your family—
	like your doctors and medications.</p>
	<p>The result? <strong>Each medical plan gets a score—a single number—so you can quickly see which ones are most compatible with your needs.</strong> </p>
	<p>Even if you want to enroll in a similar plan for 2019, it can help you compare your new medical insurance carrier options, provider networks, and how your prescription drugs will be covered.</p>
	<p>Help Me Choose does the thinking for you. </p></div>
	
	
	   
		<div id="accordion" >
				<h4 class="panel accord">How Help Me Choose works </h4>
				<div id="accord_section">
					<ul><li>Combines data from several sources to score each medical plan—your personal information, such as age, gender, ZIP code, prescription medication history, preferred doctors, and how you like to pay for things.* Also factors in national trends in health care costs and claims. </li>
					<li>Then it “predicts” how much each medical plan will cost you and how useful the benefits may be for you, and scores each option accordingly. The scores range from 1 to 100. The higher the score, the better the fit for you</li>
					<li>Get the estimated Annual RealCost™ of each plan, too—how much it would cost you to buy (what you pay out of your paycheck), and how much it predicts you’ll pay out of pocket to use the plan throughout the year. It’s based on your specific health needs and claims data from thousands of plan participants.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
							* The personal information used to calculate your results is kept completely confidential and will not be seen by Danaher.

						<li>You won’t be saving money in a tax-free Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA). </li>
